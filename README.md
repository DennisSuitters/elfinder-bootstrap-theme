Libre Theme for elFinder to fit in with Bootstrap

This Theme modifies the `theme.css` theme file, and adds SVG Icons from LibreICONS to elFinder.

Simply download this repo, and copy the `theme.css` and `svg/` files/folder to the elFinder `css` folder, and include it like any other theme for elFinder.
